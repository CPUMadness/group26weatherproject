Group 26 Weather Project

Your Github repository should include a README where you describe the following:

The steps required to deploy your application (all dependencies, port numbers, configurations, setup scripts).

Citation for the use of AI (if any).  Your citation must include:
  The AI used (i.e., ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Copilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, etc.)
  If you used a local model, please give the model used and the number of parameters, i.e. "qwen 2.5 coder 7b"
  Prompts used.
  Functions, Components, Pages, etc. that were affected.
Remember that this is a no-shame class when it comes to AI, but you MUST cite its use!

We used ChatGPT o3-mini-high to generate the basic outline code of our project. It created the basic pages of our project with working algorithms for the sign in. login, and api requests, that we edited to fit our needs. The prompt used was the text of our project proposal + "create the code outline of this project". All files were affected.
